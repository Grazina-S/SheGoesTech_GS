# # Day 10 - Work in Class - Classes and Objects
# 1. Song class
# define a class Song
# The class constructor needs to have three additional 3 parameters (self and 3 more!)
# title defaults to empty string
# author defaults to empty string
# lyrics by default empty tuple
# inside constructor method:
# set/store these three parameters inside objects variables of the same name (remember to use self!)
#  print on the screen "New Song made" - (try also printing here author and title!)
# Minimum:

# Write a method sing that prints the song line by line on the screen, first printing the author and title, if any.
# Write a method yell that prints the song in capital letters line by line on the screen, first printing the author and title, if any.

# Bonus: make the above sing and chain methods chainable, so we can call them several times (chained)

# Bonus: create an additional parameter max_lines to yell and sing methods that prints only a certain number of lines for both sing and yell. Better do with some default value e.g. -1, at which all rows are then printed.

# Create multiple songs with lyrics
# 2. Rap class
# For those feeling comfortable with class syntax, create a Rap class that inherits from Song
# # no new constructor method is necessary (you can if you want)
